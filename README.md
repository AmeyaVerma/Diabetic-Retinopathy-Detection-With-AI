Diabetic retinopathy is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the tissue at the back of the eye (retina). Poorly controlled blood sugar is a risk factor.
Early symptoms include floaters, blurriness, dark areas of vision and difficulty perceiving colors. Blindness can occur. 
This model will detects whether the given image has moderate, mild, severe, proliferate or no Diabetic retinopathy by the help of Deep Neural Networks, Residual Nets, 
and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a backend.This model has 3600 data sets and gives the accuracy of 86%.
